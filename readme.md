# Tortoise TTS Client App
This app uses the TortoiseTTS project to generate audio based on simple voice clips as the source data and a prompt.

# Installation
clone this project using the following command 
```
git clone git@github.com:gogodr/TortoiseTTS-Client.git
git submodule update --init
```
This will clone both this repo and the TortoiseTTS repo.

Then running the `install.sh` script will install all the requirements and `run.sh` will run the project from within the virtual environment created during the installation.

# Windows portable version
You can download the compiled application from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EEAu3ve1Lsj0IArUqB-Cbuo6YTcZKJx4/view?usp=sharing) and run it directly instead of going throught he installation process.
